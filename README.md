# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website that allows you to sample some of my previous work. The website is designed to meet the following acceptance criteria:

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When you load the portfolio, you will be presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

2. Clicking on any of the links in the navigation will scroll the UI to the corresponding section on the page.

3. When you click on the link to the section about the developer's work, the UI will scroll to a section that displays titled images of their applications.

4. The developer's first application image should be larger in size than the others to draw attention.

5. Clicking on the images of the applications will take you to the deployed version of each application.

6. The website should have a responsive layout that adapts to different viewport sizes, including when the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices.

## How to Use

2. You will be greeted with my name, a photo, and links to different sections of the portfolio.

3. Click on the navigation links to navigate to different sections of the portfolio, such as the About section, Work section, and Contact section.
